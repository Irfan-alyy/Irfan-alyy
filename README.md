# 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Irfan (@Irfan-alyy)

**Full-Stack Web Developer**
React & Next.js | JavaScript & TypeScript | Learning-Driven Engineer

---

I’m a full-stack developer with hands-on experience building both frontend interfaces and backend systems.
I’ve worked on multiple projects using React / Next.js for the frontend and Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Prisma on the backend, with a strong focus on authentication, scalability, and clean architecture.

I believe in learning by building, writing maintainable code, and continuously improving my understanding of modern web development.
