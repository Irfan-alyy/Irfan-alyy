👋 Hi, I’m @Irfan-alyy

💻 Passionate about crafting beautiful and functional web experiences.  My focus is on front-end development, and I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies.

🌱 Currently immersed in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and whatever exciting framework catches my eye!).

🤝 Eager to collaborate on interesting web projects. Let's build something amazing together!

⚡ Fun fact: I believe in a balanced life – coding by day, movies by night, and delicious food in between.  And I'm always on time!
